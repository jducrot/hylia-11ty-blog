I'm Jean, a software developer by day and curious human by night. 

I've been developing software professionally for almost 20 years: first as an enlistee in the U.S. Air Force, then as the contractor for various layers of government, and currently with Interfolio since 2010. I focus on front-end development and the future of accessibility for all of us aging digital users, but I've worked all over the web stack. I am passionate about science, basketball, and helping my fellow land-based mammal.

As an American dad who grew up in France, I’ve learned to speak 3 languages, moved all over this country, served in the armed forces, and am now a disabled vet living in Upstate NY. I’ve developed a unique philosophy on learning, life, and the future of technology.
