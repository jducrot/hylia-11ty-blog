I'm Jean, a software developer by day and curious human by night.

I grew up in France where I learned to speak 3 languages, moved back to the states after high school, ran a Starbucks in downtown NYC, then enlisted in the U.S.Air.Force. I've moved all over this country, became a dad of two wonderful young ladies, and eventually settled in Upstate NY.

I've developed software professionally since 2000: first in the Air Force, then as the contractor for various layers of government, and for the past decade or so in the private sector, mostly full stack.  

IN 2015 I started specializing in front-end development and championing accessible interfaces. In 2020, I took my own advice and became an accessibility engineer at The Paciello Group.

I am passionate about semantically correct interfaces, basketball, and helping my fellow land-based mammal.
