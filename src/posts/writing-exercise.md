## What?
My girlfriend Marcella runs several writing groups. I want to become a better writer so I joined the ones she runs through [Palette Cafe](www.thepalettecafe.com) in Saratoga. iT's a fun, non-judgemental group and Marcella always comes up with original challenges.

## The Format
Writer's club always starts with a 1 minute challenge. Really it always start with friendly banter, then a one minute challenge. This one was "write down as many nicknames as you can think of in 60 seconds". Thievery is always encouraged as a means of inspiration. Sharing this burst of poorly caffeinated brain jog is always smile-inducing moment and theft feels like a recognition of my peers brain blast.

## My Piece
The gang is all here, ready for the heist. The fridge is in sight but mom isn't. "That's a problem" states "Tiny" Tim. He's the brain of this leftover birthday cake retrieval operation. This is not his first rodeo. You might have heard of last weekend's great cookie thievery, and yes, that has his fingerprints all over it.

Speaking of prints, running point on the ground today is "Sticky" Sam Jackson. A graduate of "Feed Yourself Things Mom Didn't Give U" (FYTMDG) University, he's a sleight of hand master even if that means the prize remains stuck to his hand sometimes... Recon for mom is Fiona "4 Eyes" Wadsworth task this morning. She's 3 and she can cover more ground than anyone else on the squad with those zippy little legs.

Mom has been spotted, time to roll. "Love Bug" Billy runs right into the somewhat unexpected door sprung open by Fiona a couple of rooms away from the kitchen. Mom comes running. "Tiny" slaps "Sticky" on the back of the head: showtime!
