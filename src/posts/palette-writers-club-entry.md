## Details

On Saturday August 15th 2020, at [the Palette Cafe](https://www.thepalettecafe.com/), [Marcella](http://www.marcellahammer.com/) picked the topic of "change" and took us through a 1-minute brainstorm. Some of us went along the line of "changing our lives", others took it literally straight to words like "coins". In any case, thievery ensued as well as a free format 15 minutes exercise on the topic. I decided to give the [nonet format](http://www.shadowpoetry.com/resources/wip/nonet.html) a try, inspired by some of my fellow club members' past entries. Come to find out I should have looked up the definition of the format first, as I counted words, not syllables... Oh well.

## A New Day
The birth of a new day is underway.
The revolution is yours to lead. Be selfish.
How do you want to blossom? Will
You grow on yesterday's progressor
recycle your energy into a
new you? For today
is as unique
as you 
are.
