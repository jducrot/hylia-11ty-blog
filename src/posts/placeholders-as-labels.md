- labels are not for you, they are for people who've never experienced the page before
- placeholders disappear on input
- real problem when combined with no autocomplete
- why do you think some sites make it a multiple-step process? Cognitive overload
- There is a reason WCAG 3.3.2 exists if it's required you need a label and maybe instructions
- How else are you supposed to know what to put in there?
