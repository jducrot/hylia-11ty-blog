This blog is my way to keep up: keep up with technology, my kids, and life. I've decided to start blogging about important things as I experience them, learn them, or break them.

This is both to keep me accountable and engaged. I can't think of a better way to documents my goals, thoughts, and achievements. To keep me aware of where I am, where I've been, and where I am going.

## Technology

I've been debating for years how to learn more efficiently, faster, and while giving back. The second I think I can get the ball rolling I get overwhelmed with what other devs are doing, publishing, and creating. I love to read about technology and I visit my RSS feed daily. As much as it's a source of inspiration, it also ends up being a great source of impostor syndrome reinforcement. I need to start comparing myself less to others and take more pride in what I've done. A blog should give me a way to review my accomplishments.

## Kids
I love my kids and I want to teach them about technology. Last fall, with my friend [Aaron Brown](http://blog.9minutesnooze.com/), we set up a 6 weeks intro to programming class using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). It was a real challenge to keep 12 kids, 3 of them ours, focused and engaged. It was also highly rewarding. I want to do more with kids and I see my blog as a way to track my progress on that front.

## Life
Life is what you make of it. I want to keep track of that, with my family, my work, and my passions. This should give me a place to ponder my progress, evaluate my achievements and great moments. As I am about to turn 40, I've become much more aware that life is short. My mother died of cancer at 52, I was 21. My oldest daughter is now 11 and I hope that one day this blog becomes a source of inspiration, nostalgia, and not just for myself.
