## Theme and Format

Today's theme was "Fright" in honor of Halloween. The format was open ended but you couldn't write from your perspective so I decided to write as my Happween queen. on a fun note, [we ended up in the Time Union newspaper for going to vote as witches and warlocks](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Witches-bring-magic-to-the-polls-on-Halloween-15691002.php).

## My Entry

"Voting Witches" nonet as Marcella Hammer

Me and My Witches descend on GavinÂ park today

Halloween is here and we come to hunt

Intimidated mothers look with disdain and gasp

Spooked children run to their parents

Creepy darkness fills my heart

Full moon, bad witches,

Fright all Around

This is

Halloween
