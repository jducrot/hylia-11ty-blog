## Theme and Format
Today's theme was "Permission" as decided by one of the palette members in the audience. The group was large, 9 in person and 6 online. Format was left up to us so I went with an easy 10 * 10.

## My Entry
Olivier looked at me and said: "Give yourself permission today. 
To learn, to embrace without judgment, to absorb just because." 
I was stunned: "Why this? Why now?" He smiled and 
said "you know why. Let go of the fears, of 
the worry of what maybe. We are all going to 
die. I am already dead so I can only inspire 
you, Don't judge, just fly. Swim in the open ocean 
of life, hang on to the worthy and don't ever 
be sorry. Failure is never the end, but permission is 
what you can give yourself to grow before you die."
